### About Us

Welcome to YT Nexus Python API, a key component of the YT Nexus ecosystem, deployed by LX Library (https://lxlibrary.online).

In response to recent changes in YouTube's regulations that rendered previous YouTube Keyword Search (YTKS) setups ineffective (at the time of writing, changes may occur), weâ€™ve developed the YT Nexus a DB. 

This API is designed to handle video transcriptions and manage metadata efficiently by posting to the yt-nexus db which will be accessible to anyone (largely via the client side), adapting to the new constraints imposed by YouTube.

**Key Features:**
- **Transcribe YouTube Videos:** Retrieve accurate transcripts of YouTube videos using our API.
- **Channel Metadata Management:** Store and access information about YouTube channels and their videos.
- **Community Contributions:** Contribute to a collective effort by running scripts to transcribe videos and enrich our database.

We value community contributions immensely. You can get involved by:

1. **Cloning the Repository:** Access the source code and setup instructions at [YT-Nexus-DB](https://github.com/KeaganGilmore/yt-nexus-db).
2. **Running the API:** Deploy the API on your local environment to start working with video transcriptions and metadata.
3. **Contributing:** Enhance the project by improving scripts or adding new features. Your contributions help us build a more comprehensive tool for the entire community.

Due to the limitations on direct interactions with YouTube for video transcription, the effectiveness of this project relies on collaborative efforts. Your participation is crucial in creating a robust and reliable YouTube keyword search solution.

We appreciate your support in making YT Nexus a valuable resource for everyone!
